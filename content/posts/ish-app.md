Here is how I use the iSH app on my iPhone on iOS.
This app is excellent.
It basically puts an entire GNU/Linux distribution in an app with its own folder.
From there I have nano, vi, vim etc for editing text files (eMacs would be weird over the small iOS keyboard).
I can also keep and manage entire git repositories (which is how I can update this website on the go with my iPhone).
Other than that, I just like having a bash-like shell on my phone.
I can see other use cases too such as ssh client, documentation or running code snips.
Having a text editor alone is useful as iOS 15.6 does not have a way to easily edit text files.
