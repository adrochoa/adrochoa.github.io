Simple websites are great for quickly gathering information.
I plan to keep this website simple and content-focused.
Modern websites seem to have many layers of advertisements, audio, video and splash pages before getting to the desired content. Here are some websites that I think do a good job of focusing on content. I will revisit this page to add websites as I come across them.
