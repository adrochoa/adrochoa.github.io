I work in the technology sector making mathematical solutions for mobile games of chance.
My interests include science, technology, math and music.
I enjoy playing and listening to mostly classical music.
This is a website for me to share and document interests and projects.

I am studying guitar and piano as a somewhat serious amateur, with the goal of becoming literate in music theory while being able to perform some simple pieces.
I love the mandolin and ukulele for their characterful timres, but I prefer the polyphony and harmonic possibilities of guitar and piano.
Playing anything besides keys and plucked strings is rare these days.
