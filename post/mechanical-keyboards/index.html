"><p>I have been on a journey toward digital minimalism so I have been changing up some of my tools and habits
(I am typing this on an iPhone Mini 13 which is probably the most responsive device I own).
I even debate whether I should replace any of my devices since I can survive with what I have.
On my journey, I decided to try out mechanical keyboards.
My initial impression is favorable as I like the aesthetic of them.
They are responsive and have a satisfying feel to the keys and switches.
I bought two recently: a more mainstream 65% HyperX<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> with linear red switches from a local big box store and a 40% Planck that I got secondhand on eBay prebuilt<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.
I am not sure of the switches but they are fairly quiet and linear.
The smaller size of there keyboards gives me more desk space and keeps my hands in place which is supposedly more ergonomic.
I am also more conscious of centering them on my person so that I do not contort my hands and body to either side.
The 65% HyperX keyboard is what I do my day job on since I did not have to learn anything new to use it.
It is more or less equivalent to a laptop keyboard.
The Planck however is a smaller 46 key beast that has a QMK programmable firmware<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.
I have programmed it in a way to minimize the learning curve from a typical keyboard but I still require several layer (function) keys to have everything I need.
The sky is the limit however when it comes to programming these firmware keyboards as every aspect is customizable even down to having keys with varying behavior depending on whether the key is held or tapped.
My spacebar keys for example act as shift-like layer keys when held so that I can access numbers and symbols.
Check out the link to my layout on GitHub<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> (although mine is rather uninspired and just scratches the surface).
I have also linked an article with other layout ideas<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.
Right now, I am using the Planck to type this blog post and I plan to use it for my personal projects and writing.
The ortholinear layout certainly takes some getting used to but it also makes me more aware of whether I am using the digit requiring the least travel to depress a given key.
The keyboard is symmetric and so suggests how one ought to type.
Needless to say, I am working on forming better typing habits to replace my current poor ones.
Perhaps I will get better at typing on the Planck and use it full time including at work in thr future.
For now, it&rsquo;s fun to just explore alternatives to the keyboard we have all mindlessly accepted as the status quo.
These are nice keyboards for dipping your toes into the mechanical keyboard world.</p>
