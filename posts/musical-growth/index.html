				<p>Music is something that many grow fond of and attached to.
It is natural that we can all find something in this space to enjoy.
Some enjoy rock, others rap, country or just pop music in general whether from a bygone era or this one.</p>
<p>Then there are weirdos like myself who relish classical music, which I believe has stood the test of time.</p>
<p>I have a deep love of the classics: impressoinist, romantic, classical era and more recent music in classical styles.
Recently I have grown to admire classical music from India namely the Hindustani and Carnatic traditions.</p>
<p>However, baroque music is what strikes my ear&rsquo;s fancy. I delight in the immitative melodic lines, the thin texture, the careful counterpoint and the universality of this music.
It just works so well on diverse instrumentation from modern instruments like the concert flute, (modern) classical guitar, violin and piano to period instruments such as the recorder, lute, viola da gamba and harpsichord.
The beauty of this music captivates me and scarcely a day passes in which I neglect to listen to it. Of course I am fond of Telemann, Handel, Vivaldi, Rameau and Couperin, but like other baroque enthusiasts, for me, Johann Sebastian Bach stands apart as a genius and ambassador of the baroque.
His creativity and synthesis of the genre brings a level of refinement and sophistication to the baroque that is truly unique to him.
Many of his works would have sealed his place in history by themselves yet he was prolific to the point of giving us thousands of works as a composer of both church music and secular music in all styles and instrumentations of the time in Europe.
Although he never left his native Germany, he intimately studied and mastered the various national styles around him. He also has a deep Christian faith which I share with him.</p>
<p>I ultimately decided to study this music via the modern piano keyboard as a pedagogical tool as I see no better way to learn the keyboard. Baroque music demands keyboard players to have full control and independence of their hands and digits in a way that other genres of music do not. That does not mean they are worse as musical styles, I just think that playing baroque on the keyboard gives a well-balanced education. But why the keyboard? After all, I started out on the guitar in my early years and after taking a long break from playing music, decided to explore some different instruments independently in my adult years. This is also around when I developed a taste for classical music, starting with Bach&rsquo;s Cello Suites.</p>
<p>The Cello Suites are the most accessible of Bach&rsquo;s music in my humble opinion. The cello, unlike the keyboard, limits the amount of polyphony (i.e. multiple melodies) and harmony (e.g. chords) and lends a thinner texture for the uninitiated ear to follow. The cello&rsquo;s timbre is also extremely resonant and satisfying. What fascinates me in retrospect is that despite these limits, Bach manages to write polyphonic music by implying multiple melodies in one. Think of singing a two voice song alone, while switching between the melodies in real time. This is Bach&rsquo;s genius in creating what amounts to a symphony on a single unaccompanied instrument with only four strings. I am not familiar with fingerings on the cello, but I imagine these pieces are challenging for both hands technically, as well as a challenge to play sensitively and expressively.</p>
<p>I initially started out on the classical guitar in high school and college as well as dabbling with modern electric and steel string guitar. I do not know why other than I liked various genres of music utilizing electric guitar and I thought it was an accessible instrument. In reality the classical guitar has its own difficulties like all instruments do. It utilizes many complex fingering that the left hand needs to be trained for. Scales needs to be learned in several positions along the fingerboard/fretboard. Right hand technique also needs to be refined for sensitive and clean plucking. These are only the basics. I played off and on for several years, but not enough to really grow as a musician. I uterly failed at reading music, just using tab fingering which avoids learning the larger musical building blocks and internalizing the common patterns and idioms. I had fun though, and I did make some nice sounds here and there. I dabbled with other instruments too: ukulele, mandolin, recorder, diatonic flute, penny whistle. None of these really stuck although they gave me a taste for different timbres.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I finally bought a (digital) piano. I am not sure why I waited a while to get one other than the large size and the expense although I could have certainly funded one earlier. I have yet to own the real thing and I think this is part of why I waited: I knew I would have to start on a digital and I loved the &ldquo;real&rdquo; sound of a vibrating string and soundboard. My curiosity of the keys was consumated after moving on from the cello suites to Bach&rsquo;s keyboard music: French Suites, English Suites, Partitas, Well-Tempered Clavier, Inventions and Sinfonia, etc. The complex polyphony and the genius in bringing together multiple independent melodies with satisfying immitation and counterpoint really satisfied my ear. I was (and still am) hooked to say the least. With my piano under my fingers, I have the goal of learning the works of Bach. Although I have tried playing some of his music on the guitar, I ultimately resigned that to really play it properly, I need to play on a keyboard. I am far and away from playing this difficult repertoire. Right now, I am working on easier pieces found in the books for his son Wilhelm Friedeman Bach and his wife Anna Magdalena Bach. Invention and Sinfonia and selections from WTC will be next.</p>
