                <p><em>Update: I have since switched to using Github Actions<a href="%5Bhttps://github.com/features/actions%5D(https://github.com/features/actions)">^1</a>. See my post <a href="/github-actions/">here</a> for the details. This way can still serve many people however, so this post will remain. What I like about using Github Actions is that it enables me to more easily update this site on the go.</em></p><p>This is a simple static website as a portfolio of my work and interests.
I wanted to create a legitimate website and not only use social media (although I want to start using Twitter and Soundcloud too).</p><p>The following approach worked for me but I know it is also fairly technical.
There are many managed approaches to creating a website that are pretty cheap and do not require technical skills.
I stumbled upon blot.im<a href="%5Bhttps://blot.im/%5D(https://blot.im/)">^2</a> for example. It is only a few dollars a month and reduces making a website to putting files in a folder.</p><p>For this website however, I decided to use Hugo<a href="%5Bhttps://gohugo.io/%5D(https://gohugo.io/)">^3</a> and my Github account with Github Pages<a href="%5Bhttps://pages.github.com/%5D(https://pages.github.com/)">^4</a>. Hugo is a simple static website generator written in the Go programming language.
Github Pages is a way of turning your repository named <code>username.github.io</code> into a static website with that same URL.
It is a fast and easy enough workflow for me and only Markdown<a href="%5Bhttps://www.markdownguide.org/%5D(https://www.markdownguide.org/)">^5</a> is needed to edit posts. Additionally, this is all free (meaning there is no cost).
The skills required to do this are a proficiency with git version control<a href="%5Bhttps://git-scm.com/%5D(https://git-scm.com/)">^6</a> and using command line tools in general.</p><p>For themeing, as of this writing, I am using the etch<a href="%5Bhttps://github.com/LukasJoswiak/etch%5D(https://github.com/LukasJoswiak/etch)">^7</a> theme which I chose for its absolute simplicity.
I really want the site to be focused on content and this theme is great at staying out of the way.</p><p>Tools Recap:</p><ul>
<li>Git, Github Repositories and Github Pages (for version control and hosting)</li>
<li>Markdown Editor for posts (Apostrophe<a href="%5Bhttps://gitlab.gnome.org/World/apostrophe%5D(https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/apostrophe)">^8</a>, Marker<a href="%5Bhttps://fabiocolacio.github.io/Marker/%5D(https://fabiocolacio.github.io/Marker/)">^9</a> or VS Code<a href="%5Bhttps://code.visualstudio.com/%5D(https://code.visualstudio.com/)">^10</a> for example)</li>
<li>Hugo to generate the website</li>
</ul>
<p>I did this on a GNU/Linux system installed on an old HP Stream laptop. I installed Hugo with Snap<a href="%5Bhttps://snapcraft.io/hugo%5D(https://snapcraft.io/hugo)">^11</a> since it is the latest version.
Git can be installed from your Linux distributions package repository in the usual way. The same or similar procedures should work with Windows or MacOS.
But basically, with these tools one can create a user website via a repository in Github called <code>username.github.io</code> (which is also the website URL).
This is then used as a submodule to your Hugo project repository (<code>username.generator</code> in my case). The theme is also a submodule in case it gets updated upstream.
Using this approach keeps everything clean and version controlled: you can always roll back if your website breaks.</p><p>Here is a tree of the directory/repository structure:</p><pre><code>~/Public/adrochoa.generator$ tree -d -L 2
.
├── adrochoa.github.io
│   ├── about
│   ├── categories
│   ├── css
│   ├── my-first-post
│   ├── posts
│   └── tags
├── archetypes
├── content
│   ├── about
│   └── posts
├── resources
│   └── _gen
└── themes
    └── etch
</code></pre>
<p><code>etch</code>, <code>adrochoa.github.io</code> and <code>adrochoa.generator</code> are separate repositories.
Using the submodule approach, the outer repository, <code>adrochoa.generator</code> commits the commit hashes of the subrepositories, but not the content.
The inner repositories, <code>etch</code> and <code>adrochoa.github.io</code>, are independent of any other repository as far as Git is concerned.
We never directly modify <code>adrochoa.github.io</code> or <code>etch</code>: Hugo will modify <code>adrochoa.github.io</code> for us based on our Markdown file posts and we leave themeing to the etch folks.
So once this is set up, we only need to edit some Markdown and run Hugo in the command-line.
Then we just commit and push everything. Github Pages will render the update. Here are some links with more details on these tools and the nuts and bolts of this approach.</p>

                <p>I have been on a journey toward digital minimalism so I have been changing up some of my tools and habits
(I am typing this on an iPhone Mini 13 which is probably the most responsive device I own).
I even debate whether I should replace any of my devices since I can survive with what I have.
On my journey, I decided to try out mechanical keyboards.
My initial impression is favorable as I like the aesthetic of them.
They are responsive and have a satisfying feel to the keys and switches.
I bought two recently: a more mainstream 65% HyperX<a href="%5Bhttps://hyperx.com/products/hyperx-alloy-origins-65%5D(https://hyperx.com/products/hyperx-alloy-origins-65)">^1</a> with linear red switches from a local big box store and a 40% Planck that I got secondhand on eBay prebuilt<a href="%5Bhttps://drop.com/buy/planck-mechanical-keyboard%5D(https://drop.com/buy/planck-mechanical-keyboard)">^2</a>.
I am not sure of the switches but they are fairly quiet and linear.
The smaller size of there keyboards gives me more desk space and keeps my hands in place which is supposedly more ergonomic.
I am also more conscious of centering them on my person so that I do not contort my hands and body to either side.
The 65% HyperX keyboard is what I do my day job on since I did not have to learn anything new to use it.
It is more or less equivalent to a laptop keyboard.
The Planck however is a smaller 46 key beast that has a QMK programmable firmware<a href="%5Bhttps://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/thevankeyboards/minivan/keymaps/jetpacktuxedo%5D(https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/thevankeyboards/minivan/keymaps/jetpacktuxedo)">^3</a>.
I have programmed it in a way to minimize the learning curve from a typical keyboard but I still require several layer (function) keys to have everything I need.
The sky is the limit however when it comes to programming these firmware keyboards as every aspect is customizable even down to having keys with varying behavior depending on whether the key is held or tapped.
My spacebar keys for example act as shift-like layer keys when held so that I can access numbers and symbols.
Check out the link to my layout on GitHub<a href="%5Bhttps://github.com/adrochoa/qmk_firmware/tree/personal%5D(https://github.com/adrochoa/qmk_firmware/tree/personal)">^4</a> (although mine is rather uninspired and just scratches the surface).
I have also linked an article with other layout ideas<a href="%5Bhttps://evantravers.com/articles/2019/04/20/community-post-40-keyboard-layouts/%5D(https://evantravers.com/articles/2019/04/20/community-post-40-keyboard-layouts/)">^5</a>.
Right now, I am using the Planck to type this blog post and I plan to use it for my personal projects and writing.
The ortholinear layout certainly takes some getting used to but it also makes me more aware of whether I am using the digit requiring the least travel to depress a given key.
The keyboard is symmetric and so suggests how one ought to type.
Needless to say, I am working on forming better typing habits to replace my current poor ones.
Perhaps I will get better at typing on the Planck and use it full time including at work in thr future.
For now, it’s fun to just explore alternatives to the keyboard we have all mindlessly accepted as the status quo.
These are nice keyboards for dipping your toes into the mechanical keyboard world.</p>

This app is excellent.
It basically puts an entire GNU/Linux distribution in an app with its own folder.
From there I have nano, vi, vim etc for editing text files (eMacs would be weird over the small iOS keyboard).
I can also keep and manage entire git repositories (which is how I can update this website on the go with my iPhone).
Other than that, I just like having a bash-like shell on my phone.
I can see other use cases too such as ssh client, documentation or running code snips.
Having a text editor alone is useful as iOS 15.6 does not have a way to easily edit text files.</p><ol>

  <p>
    Having read Cal Newport's <em>Deep Work</em>, I desire to document my pursuit in creating a better work-life balance by training my mind to be disciplined in this art of focus and "deep work", a term that Newport contrasts with "shallow work". I will write about my journey living a deep and focused life, pursuing my main interests of mathematics, music, spoken language and general nerd potpourri.
  </p>

  <p>
    My life in code:
  </p>
<pre class="line-numbers  language-python"><code>while (alive):
    work_deeply()
</code></pre>

  <p>
    While there are other things to do besides work, centering our lives around our quiet, distraction-free, focused work time is essential for a satisfying and quality life. We all have to make money to live and survive. We may as well do it in the most wholesome way we can: ensure that when you work, you are focused, undistracted and attaining depth. This will derive great satisfaction.
  </p>

  <p>
    For me, deep work includes doing mathematics for my day job, mastering musical pieces that interest me and are at my skill level and studying foreign language to better communicate with my loved ones and for the upcoming unscheduled trip to Europe and South Asia one day (dream trips I hope to come true).
