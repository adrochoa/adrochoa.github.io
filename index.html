		Music is something that many grow fond of and attached to. It is natural that we can all find something in this space to enjoy. Some enjoy rock, others rap, country or just pop music in general whether from a bygone era or this one.
Then there are weirdos like myself who relish classical music, which I believe has stood the test of time.
I have a deep love of the classics: impressoinist, romantic, classical era and more recent music in classical styles.

	<div>
		Having read Cal Newport&rsquo;s Deep Work, I desire to document my pursuit in creating a better work-life balance by training my mind to be disciplined in this art of focus and &ldquo;deep work&rdquo;, a term that Newport contrasts with &ldquo;shallow work&rdquo;. I will write about my journey living a deep and focused life, pursuing my main interests of mathematics, music, spoken language and general nerd potpourri.
My life in code:

	<h1><a href="https://adrochoa.github.io/posts/simple-websites/">Simple Websites</a></h1>
	<b><time>23.06.2024 21:05</time></b>
	
	<div>
		Simple websites are great for quickly gathering information. I plan to keep this website simple and content-focused. Modern websites seem to have many layers of advertisements, audio, video and splash pages before getting to the desired content. Here are some websites that I think do a good job of focusing on content. I will revisit this page to add websites as I come across them.

	<div>
		Here I will keep a list of useful formulae in Microsoft Excel. These will probably also work in other spreadsheet software such as Gnumeric or LibreOffice Calc.
Lookup all values with corresponding key (spill) =FILTER($$key_range,key=$$value_range) Lookup right to left =INDEX($$total_range,MATCH(key,$$key_range,FALSE),1) Two way lookup =INDEX($$value_only_range,MATCH(row_key,$$row_range,FALSE),MATCH(column_key,$$column_range,FALSE)) Get every nth column (negative n goes backward) =OFFSET($first_cell,0,n*(COLUMN()-COLUMN($first_lookup_cell))) Get every nth row (negative n goes backward) =OFFSET($first_cell,n*(ROW()-ROW($first_lookup_cell)),0) Check whether cell contains character =ISNUMBER(SEARCH(char, cell)) http://www.gnumeric.org/ https://www.

	<b><time>23.06.2024 21:04</time></b>
	
	<div>
		Here is how I use the iSH app on my iPhone on iOS. This app is excellent. It basically puts an entire GNU/Linux distribution in an app with its own folder. From there I have nano, vi, vim etc for editing text files (eMacs would be weird over the small iOS keyboard). I can also keep and manage entire git repositories (which is how I can update this website on the go with my iPhone).

	<b><time>23.06.2024 21:03</time></b>
	
	<div>
		I have been on a journey toward digital minimalism so I have been changing up some of my tools and habits (I am typing this on an iPhone Mini 13 which is probably the most responsive device I own). I even debate whether I should replace any of my devices since I can survive with what I have. On my journey, I decided to try out mechanical keyboards. My initial impression is favorable as I like the aesthetic of them.

		Update: I have since switched to using Github Actions1. See my post here for the details. This way can still serve many people however, so this post will remain. What I like about using Github Actions is that it enables me to more easily update this site on the go.
This is a simple static website as a portfolio of my work and interests. I wanted to create a legitimate website and not only use social media (although I want to start using Twitter and Soundcloud too).
